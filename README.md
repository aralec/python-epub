Converts all epub files in ressources folder to pdf.

> **Note :** Some epub files are protected by DRMs. It is not illegal to remove the
DRM protection, if it is for personnal usage only. I may or may not look into
that in the future, as there is some Python extensions to the Calibre Software
that de-DRM protect epub files.
